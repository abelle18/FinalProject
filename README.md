# FinalProject
# Book Tracker

## Problem Solved
My program allows its user to save books they want to read and books they have read to separate lists that continues to save data between each use. Additionally, this program allows management of book lists, allowing the user to remove books from saved data lists. This program also utilizes input validation and exception handling.

## Features
- Add the books you want to read
- Mark your books as read
- View both your reading and read lists (saved)
- Remove books from either lists
- Your data will be saved in the `reading.txt` and `read.txt`
- Uses arrays for read, uses ArrayLists for "to read", uses recursion for the inputvalidator, uses file persistence to save txt files to reference again, and uses try-catch (checekd exception)

## How to Run
1. Enter the repo link, open GitHub & run codespace.
2. Run the program by using Github website or application.
3. Follow the promts to experience the program! P.S. error message on first run until you save data
